Who’s your favorite Katy Vision character - Lefty or Ebi (Twerking Tempura)?
I want to close this with a poll...
"...For example, Santa Barbara Katy is actually what I wear in Santa Barbara - hippie linen flow"
"I wanted to pick highlights from every era, not just current ones &amp; I wanted to reflect who I am on and off stage..."
"Ha! Pulling the tech curtain aside to tell you it's just a random name generator, but makes me LOL every time."
"...like my hot pink Moschino dress, could become tangible to you in the future..."
"Expect the unexpected! For example, things that you see in that alternate world..."
...Almost 75% of those locations will be places I’ve had IRL memorable moments in.
...the game will continue to update with new locations throughout its
"I incorporated some of my favorites places in the game, from my hometown of Santa Barbara to Tokyo..."
"...and in the reality of the music industry, you must have talent first and foremost."
"...record label has helped write this storyline, but at the end of the day, this is not a talent-based game, it's a skill-based"
"I think there are actual tools that can set you on the path. For example, my experience with starting my own..."
...I don't think we're that far off.
"I would say Katy Vision, but according to the technology I saw during my visit to Silicon Valley last week..."
I thought this would be fun way to tell my story and offer insight through poppy cartoon visuals.
I enjoy creating alternate worlds...
"...for example, my holiday onesies are in your game closets now, as they are in my real closet"
My favorite thing is to be able to update the game in real time per my imagination...
...it will be a continually interactive space where a lot of my creative branches can live &amp; I can offer them a lot of firsts

You should google Kerry Max Cook his story is fascinating and heart breaking
This will now prevent him from receiving the compensation he deserves for the decades he spent on death
These are the types of media stories I Google when I can't
"Wait prosecutors agreed to drop the murder charges, but they will continue to oppose Cook’s claims of actual innocence. Always a hang"
His chargers were just dropped after DNA evidence was finally brought in and cleared him. Can u imagine being wrongly imprisoned for 40
Just read the story of Kerry Max Cook. He had been on death row for a murder he didn't commit for almost 40

Hope y'all loved that. Just wanted you to know how hard I've been working on this show these past few months.
Just got chill bumps watching that footage. Next time you see me on that stage it will be the real deal!
"""Everytime"" has become one of my favorite moments in the show. My boys said they loved it too :)"
We've grown so close. It's like I get to perform with my family on stage :)
The things we have all learned about each these past couple weeks is pretty amazing.
Is this the first time some of you are seeing the stage? What do you think????
Fingers crossed we can fit Alien into the show on the next go-round. I must bring that song to life!!!
It's so important to be conscious of what's happening in the world and to give love wherever &amp; whenever you can.
"We had deep fried turkey, deviled eggs, corn bread… all the yummy southern food you could ever want. Daddy's the best cook."
Omg my heart is melting watching Jayden on the piano.
Just want this show to be perfect &amp; the costumes are so important. Promise y'all will love what we ended up coming up with.
"I'm a perfectionist, I can't help it."

"I tend to write from experience, but also enjoy fantasizing &amp; writing from imagination."
I used this album to get out everything I'd bottled up over the last few years...
It also has a lot of personal songs. Songs that are very moody and vibe driven.

Surround yourself with those who pick you up when others put you
Maybe the next time you want to cut someone down... Take a second to listen to what they have to say. Life's too short to be mean..
Compassion and empathy are key character traits to have in order to rebuild all relations with
And sometimes grudges aren't meant to be held but when words cut deep enough... It makes it really hard to move
It's important to remember. Sometimes your words may be forgiven but they cannot be forgotten.. Are your words worth

"""Success comes when you want it more than you want to sleep... When you want it more than you need to"
Looking back.. Those who told me what I didn't want to hear when I NEEDED to hear it are the ones I trust the most in my life
The truth may hurt and the truth may suck to hear but it can save you
"If everyone around you agrees with you 100% of the time, you may want to reevaluate those around"
Surround yourself with people who aren't afraid of your response to their honesty. Surround yourself with those who aren't afraid to say
"The ones who are honest with you, are the ones who love"
